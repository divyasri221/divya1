3.Here is a comprehensive guide for performing file management tasks using basic HDFS and Linux commands:
(i) Creating a directory in HDFS
To create a directory in HDFS, use the hadoop fs -mkdir command:
hadoop fs -mkdir /user/hdfs/new_directory
This command creates a directory named new_directory under /user/hdfs/.
(ii) Moving forth and back to directories
To navigate between directories in the terminal, use the following commands:
To move to a directory: 
cd /path/to/directory
To go back to the previous directory: 
cd ..
(iii) Listing directory contents
To list the contents of a directory, use:
hadoop fs -ls /user/hdfs/
This command lists the files and directories in the specified path of HDFS.
For local directories:
ls /path/to/local/directory
(iv) Uploading and downloading a file in HDFS
To upload a file from the local filesystem to HDFS: 
hadoop fs -put /local/path/to/file /hdfs/destination/path
To download a file from HDFS to the local filesystem: 
hadoop fs -get /hdfs/path/to/file /local/destination/path
(v) Checking the contents of the file
To check the contents of a file in HDFS, use:
hadoop fs -cat /path/to/hdfs/file
For local files, you can use:
cat /local/path/to/file
(vi) Copying and moving files
To copy files within HDFS: 
hadoop fs -cp /path/to/source /path/to/destination
To move files within HDFS: 
hadoop fs -mv /path/to/source /path/to/destination
(vii) Copying and moving files between local to HDFS environment
To copy a file from the local system to HDFS: 
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /local/path/to/file /hdfs/path/to/destination
To copy a file from HDFS to the local system: 
hadoop fs -copyToLocal /hdfs/path/to/file /local/path/to/destination
To move files from local to HDFS: 
hadoop fs -moveFromLocal /local/path/to/file /hdfs/destination/path
(viii) Removing files and paths
To remove a file in HDFS: 
hadoop fs -rm /path/to/hdfs/file
To remove a directory in HDFS (and its contents): 
hadoop fs -rm -r /path/to/hdfs/directory
For local files:
rm /local/path/to/file
(ix) Displaying few lines of a file
To display the first few lines of a file in HDFS, use:
hadoop fs -head /path/to/hdfs/file
For local files:
head /local/path/to/file
(x) Display the aggregate length of a file
To get the length of a file in HDFS, use:
hadoop fs -du -s /path/to/hdfs/file
For local files, you can use:
du -sh /local/path/to/file
(xi) Checking the permissions of a file
To check the permissions of a file or directory in HDFS:
hadoop fs -ls /path/to/hdfs/file
For local files:
ls -l /local/path/to/file
(xii) Zipping and unzipping the files with & without permission pasting it to a location
To zip a file: 
zip filename.zip /path/to/file
To unzip a file: 
unzip filename.zip
To preserve permissions when copying or zipping/unzipping:
When copying in Linux:
cp -p /path/to/file /destination/path
For HDFS operations, use hadoop fs -copyFromLocal or hadoop fs -put which preserve file attributes during the transfer.
(xiii) Copy, Paste commands
Copy (for local files): 
cp /path/to/source /path/to/destination
Paste (just move the file or copy to a new location): 
mv /path/to/source /path/to/destination
These are the basic commands and their usage to manage files and directories in both HDFS and the local environment.
